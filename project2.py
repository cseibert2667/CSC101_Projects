import random

# 1 = rock, 2 = paper, 3 = scissors
# get inputs for player names & num_rounds
# make sure num_rounds is positive
# print p1 vs p2 for x rounds
# random player inputs (random.randint(1,3))
# loop for number of rounds
    # print tie if inputs match
    # identify winner, increment player wins, get new random inputs
# print final score
